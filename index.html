        <h3>A funny story</h3>
            <p class="story">I once locked myself out of the house with my 4-year old child alone in the house. We didn't have a doorbell at the time so I had to throw small stones at the window, hoping she would hear it and take a look outside. When she finally heard me, I had to wave at her to tell her to open the door as she couldn't hear me. <br >
             <br />Eventually she went downstairs and opened the door to let me in. I called her my hero after that and she still keeps on saying that she's my hero.</p>
        
        <h4>TL;DR</h4>
            <p>My 4-year old daughter opened the door of my house when I locked myself out. </p>
